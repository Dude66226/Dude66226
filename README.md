- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dude66226
- 👀 I’m interested in Block Chain and EDI; I just love programming anything, started with C, worked in Java, PHP, C#. Mainly wrote code for othere companies, now I'm looking to do it for myself as well.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Block Chain, trying to mine anything.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, probably some mining project.
